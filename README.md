### Installation

    git clone git://github.com/d-lord/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

    ./install # dotbot

## Notes
Vim (esp. complex plugins) may complain about Python if that's not installed (use homebrew)

Tmux will quit with "[exited]" if homebrew hasn't been used to install reattach-to-user-namespace
