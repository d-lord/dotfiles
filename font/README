Fonts currently only used for vim-airline plugin.
Fonts are larger than most vim plugins.
Note that they aren't handled by Vim, but are used by it, hence their inclusion in this repo.
On OSX, font installation is done by copying fonts into the ~/Library/Fonts or /Library/Fonts folder.
Fonts are a little tricky - the system running Vim needs to have them installed for vim-airline to look good. Currently vimrc just tries to use one, and if it fails, assumes vim-airline isn’t going to go well. Doesn’t disable it though.
